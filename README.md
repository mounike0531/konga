That k-fold cross validation is a procedure used to estimate the skill of the model on new data. There are common tactics that you can use to select the value of k for your dataset. There are commonly used variations on cross-validation such as stratified and repeated that are available in scikit-learn

What is K-fold accuracy?

k-fold cross-validation is one of the most popular strategies widely used by data scientists. ... One can build a perfect model on the training data with 100% accuracy or 0 error, but it may fail to generalize for unseen data. So, it is not a good model. It overfits the training data.
